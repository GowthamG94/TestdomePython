# TestdomePython

Since I have been out of school for a few months, I figured that I could use some extra practice with Python to make sure I maintain my level of profficiency. 

In this repository I am answering some sample Pythin interview questions supplied by testdome.com [(link to full set of questions)](https://www.testdome.com/d/python-interview-questions/9).

Each file in this repository corresponds to one of the questions from the link above. While I assume the filenames will be descriptive enough to know which files correspond to which questions, I will also provide a direct link to the question I am answering in the header comments of the file.
